# Utilizing a Let's Encrypt SSL Cert on a Synology NAS
Synology requires a plugin to utilize Syncthing.


1. Go to Package Center and enable Community Packages
  - Settings > Package Sources > Add
  - Name: Synocommunity
  - URL: http://packages.synocommunity.com/
2. Click the Community tab that appears > search for & install Syncthing
3. Once installed, set the GUI username & password for Syncthing

***

### On the Synology box: Setup for Syncthing:
- Login to the machine via SSH:
```bash
ssh your_admin_name@yoursynologyboxhost
```

- Change into the directory where the default certs live
```bash
cd /usr/syno/etc/certificate/system/ && ls -l
```

- Change the permissions on the cert directory, so Syncthing's user can write to the `default` folder, where the certs live
```bash
chown sc-syncthing:root default/
```

- Make a backup of the native certs
```bash
cd default && mkdir certbackup &&
mv cert.pem certbackup/cert.pem &&
mv fullchain.pem certbackup/fullchain.pem &&
mv privkey.pem certbackup/privkey.pem &&
mv syno-ca-cert.pem certbackup/syno-ca-cert.pem
```

- After you initiate the share from the Cert server, a prompt should appear on the new Synology machine.
- If the share doesnâ€™t appear, go into Remote Devices > Edit > Advanced > Addresses: change from dynamic to tcp://[your synology ip]:22000 *(the IP of the Synology box/destination server)*

### Required Options Before Hitting "Save" on the Connection from Your Cert Machine
- When your Synology's Syncthing accepts the share from your Cert server, make the **destination**: `/usr/syno/etc/certificate/system/default/`
- Advanced tab > Receive Only > Save
- Ignore tab:
```text
certbackup
syno-ca-cert.pem
```
- Save

The wildcard cert should appear shortly after.

## Setting up the Automation
- Log into the Synology admin, https://[your synology ip]:5001 and set up a task to restart nginx every week (that way, we don't need to code anything for forceful restarts after a cert update.)
- Set up a task to restart Nginx every week:
- Control Panel > Task Scheduler > Create > Scheduled Task > User-Defined Script:
  -  Task: Restart nginx for SSL
  -  User: root

**Under the Schedule tab:**

-  Run the following days: Sun

**Time**
-  First Run: 02:07
-  Frequency: Everyday (every Sunday)

**Task Settings**
- Run command > User-Defined Script:
```bash
synoservice --restart nginx
```
